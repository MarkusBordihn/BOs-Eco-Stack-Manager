Eco Stack Manager helps optimize Minecraft servers by managing and cleaning up item stacks, XP
orbs and user inventories.

It is an advanced version of the [Adaptive Performance Tweaks: Items][aptweaks] mod and is
compatible with Forge, Fabric, and NeoForge.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Stacking Items and Blocks**: Automatically stack items and blocks on the server side to reduce
  clutter and improve performance.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes older or excessive items and blocks from the world to keep your
  server running smoothly.
- **Stacking XP Orbs**: Combines XP orbs within a specified range to reduce lag from large XP farms.
- **Client-Side Transformations**: Converts multiple items into blocks (e.g., 64 coal into 1 coal
  block) when picked up or in the inventory to simplify management. (WIP)
- **Server-Side Optimization**: Operates entirely on the server side to avoid any client-side lag or
  issues.

## Usage

Simply install the mod on your server and it will start managing and optimizing item stacks and XP
orbs automatically. No additional configuration is required.
